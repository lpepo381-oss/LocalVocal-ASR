LocalVocal ASR – Daily Log 2026‑01‑07
1. Goal of the Day
- [x] Start with the first test recordings in Audacity to get a feeling for microphone behavior, levels, and recording quality.
2. Why I’m Doing This
Today I’m starting my first voice recordings because an ASR model can only work well if it is trained on my own voice.
My goal is to build a system that:
- recognizes my natural speaking style
- understands my pronunciation, pauses, and personal quirks
- works reliably later in the LocalVocal project
For that, I need clean, consistent, and realistic recordings that reflect how I actually speak in everyday situations.
Today is not about recording a full dataset — it’s about laying the foundation:
getting familiar with the recording process and building a routine that I can continue over the next days and weeks.
3. Concrete Steps
-Opened Audacity and checked the basic recording setup
-Tested the HyperX QuadCast microphone (levels, distance, pop filter)
-Created the first short test recordings to evaluate quality
-Plan a recording routine for the next days
-Sort files and move them into the project structure
4. Technical Details
- Software: Audacity 3.7.7.0
- Microphone: HyperX QuadCast
- Recommended microphone distance: approx. 12–15 cm
- Target level: around −12 dB
- Recording format: WAV, 48 kHz, mono (optimal for ASR)
- Folder structure:
- data/raw/2026-01-07/
- data/processed/ (for later normalization)
5. Results
- First test recordings successfully created
- Microphone setup sounds clear and stable
- Basic workflow for future recording sessions is established
- Next step: record longer samples and find a consistent speaking style
6. Reflection
- The start feels good and manageable — today wasn’t about recording a lot, but about beginning the process.
- I notice that having a clear routine will help me record a little bit every day.
- For tomorrow: record 2–3 minutes of natural speech and sort the first files.
7. Next Steps
- Record 2–3 minutes of natural speech tomorrow
- Test different speaking styles (normal, quiet, clearer, faster)
- Sort files into data/raw/2026-01-07/
- Think about which text types I want to record later
- Create a checklist for consistent recordings
- Optional: note which sentences work especially well for ASR.
